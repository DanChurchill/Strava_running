"Sep 3, 2018, 2:43:02 PM","Great job, Ben!  The elevation on that third mile looks tough!"
"Sep 13, 2018, 5:36:26 PM","Not bad, about 10 sec slower than I would have liked.  I should have done another warm up mile first and picked a route with less storm debris."
"Oct 15, 2018, 2:25:12 PM",I was wondering what happened on Saturday.  Nice job getting back out there on a tough weather day!
"Nov 15, 2018, 11:33:17 PM",Do it!
"Nov 17, 2018, 5:48:46 PM",Looks like those easy days did some good. Glad you‚Äôre feeling fast again!
"Nov 17, 2018, 5:49:31 PM",Maybe 3:30. We‚Äôll see how a 20-22 miler feels after rock and roll. 
"Dec 2, 2018, 7:45:11 PM",Thanks!  All credit goes to my awesome training partners!
"Dec 2, 2018, 9:08:56 PM","Sorry about the cramp, looks like you were going strong before that.  A lot of people struggled out there today as the weather got warmer."
"Dec 4, 2018, 4:11:42 PM","My left calf still has a pretty good knot in it, but other than that the legs are just a little heavy.  How are you guys feeling?"
"Dec 6, 2018, 4:00:54 PM",Good to see you back!
"Dec 17, 2018, 4:55:15 PM","I am fast! I am very fast! I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot."
"Dec 27, 2018, 2:41:47 PM",Training through Christmas week is tough.  I'm sure you'll feel back to normal next week.
"Dec 28, 2018, 2:17:34 PM","""In an ideal world, I would have all 10 fingers on my left hand so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.""  I don't think you can ever run out of office quotes..."
"Dec 30, 2018, 2:32:27 PM",Houston marathon in 3 weeks!
"Dec 30, 2018, 4:48:52 PM","üòù How would I describe myself? Three words: hardworking, alpha male, jackhammer, merciless, insatiable."
"Jan 5, 2019, 1:02:12 AM",Good luck!
"Jan 5, 2019, 5:24:10 PM",You guys were flying out there!
"Jan 5, 2019, 5:33:42 PM",You had a long morning before the run even started.  Thanks for setting up the water today!
"Jan 16, 2019, 6:45:50 PM",Every time I look at the forecast it is colder and the wind gets stronger!  
"Jan 18, 2019, 4:20:16 PM",Thanks!  Looks like it is going to be a cold and windy one...
"Jan 20, 2019, 7:46:57 PM",That‚Äôs a great time especially considering the hamstring trouble!
"Jan 20, 2019, 7:50:16 PM",Sorry you couldn‚Äôt run but glad you shut it down when you did. It‚Äôs definitely it worth risking your buildup for Boston!
"Jan 22, 2019, 7:09:41 PM",Great work!
"Jan 22, 2019, 7:13:36 PM",That does not look fun.  Especially that 4th mile!
"Feb 2, 2019, 11:49:18 PM","Thanks!  I think the short course makes it look a little better, but I was pretty happy with the result for an off day."
"Feb 3, 2019, 5:25:52 PM","Nice pace!  Probably would have still been under 19 if the course was correct, which is awesome especially with that hill. "
"Feb 3, 2019, 9:36:35 PM","lol.  Thanks, Jon.  The shoes are awesome!"
"Feb 5, 2019, 10:00:40 PM",Pull up injured or accidentally stopped the watch?

"Feb 16, 2019, 6:11:01 PM",Great job!  I bet that was a blast!  Was there a lot of runners?
"Feb 24, 2019, 12:21:57 AM",Thanks!  It was definitely encouraging after some mediocre workouts over the last few weeks.  Glad to see you're getting back up to speed!
"Feb 24, 2019, 4:34:41 PM",The El Alebrije March 30. It‚Äôs the same company that did yesterday‚Äôs race. I signed up for the whole series of nine races but now I‚Äôm worried they will all be short. 
"Feb 26, 2019, 6:36:07 PM",Nice work!  Hope the foot pain isn't anything serious.
"Mar 5, 2019, 12:51:38 AM",Thanks!  Doing some shorter intervals to try and get some speed back.
"Mar 8, 2019, 7:05:22 PM",Thanks!  
"Mar 9, 2019, 9:54:30 PM",Great job!  Way to push through that tough weather out there today. 
"Mar 18, 2019, 5:28:24 PM","Nice pace, and at 3:45 AM?  That's dedication!"
"Mar 20, 2019, 7:28:14 PM","Great. They stole my laptop.
Yeah, well, they stole my surge protector.
How does that even compare!
I'm now going to be prone to surges!"
"Apr 2, 2019, 4:43:32 PM","How did the hills affect you last year? That 150ft of climbing in the first 3 miles could be rough, but then the last three look pretty much all downhill.   I was thinking of shooting for 41:XX, but I'm second guessing myself..."
"Apr 2, 2019, 5:21:54 PM",Thanks!  I didn't even think about the added distance.  Looking on Strava at other runners from last year it looks like a lot of people run much faster in the second half like you did.  Lets hope the weather cooperates!
"Apr 8, 2019, 4:24:13 PM",Too bad about the race cancellation yesterday!  Today's weather would have been perfect.
"Apr 10, 2019, 9:59:18 PM",We must have juuuust missed each other! 
"Apr 15, 2019, 8:57:29 PM",Nice work!
"Apr 15, 2019, 10:39:10 PM","Yeah, i need to take the 5 lbs off and get the volume back up a little.  This 20-30 a week isn‚Äôt doing anything for me. "
"Apr 15, 2019, 10:42:59 PM",Great job on a tough day!
"Apr 16, 2019, 1:01:46 AM",Really impressive!  After a less than ideal training cycle and a crazy weather day you still put up a great time.  
"Apr 17, 2019, 10:54:55 PM",Either a bike or car was used and was not a run.  Activity has miles in under 3 minutes.

"Apr 29, 2019, 1:34:36 PM",Nice work!!
"Apr 30, 2019, 1:29:17 AM","Yeah, short again so I'll try again next month.  Getting faster, but still looking for that legit sub 20."
"May 18, 2019, 5:38:14 PM",I didn‚Äôt run a cool down so I left around 8:15. I‚Äôm wishing I hadn‚Äôt paid for the whole series since they have all been 3 milers so far. I‚Äôm just using them as tempo runs and will go for a sub 20 in the fall. 
"Jun 1, 2019, 3:13:39 PM",Nice work!  Looks a little hilly out in the new neighborhood 
"Jun 1, 2019, 11:30:39 PM",The park was packed this morning!  I was trying to get some miles in while staying close to water fountains. 
"Jun 5, 2019, 2:37:49 AM",It was!  So glad I waited for the rain to clear. 
"Jun 9, 2019, 12:28:55 AM","You're welcome any time!  We mostly meet on Saturdays if you can join us then, but we may do an odd Sunday here and there depending on everyone's schedule."
"Jun 22, 2019, 3:49:02 PM","Well done, boys!  No way I was going to be able to hang with you today!"
"Jul 14, 2019, 6:31:48 PM",BQ or bust!
"Jul 16, 2019, 2:54:15 PM",Do you adjust your paces for the heat?  Trying to hit marathon pace now is much different than what it will be in the fall or winter when it's 40-50 degrees cooler. 
"Jul 19, 2019, 3:06:37 PM","Thanks, Glenn!"
"Jul 20, 2019, 7:19:38 PM","Not a baby clown, a clown baby- it's like a baby- it's like a clown that is a baby"
"Jul 28, 2019, 1:14:00 AM",Thanks Veronica Carrillo.  I need to come run with you fast folks one of these days!
"Jul 28, 2019, 1:18:03 AM",Great title! I wish I could think of a quote from that episode that wouldn‚Äôt be horribly offensive. 
"Aug 10, 2019, 3:11:12 PM",Welcome!  Driscoll Middle school on Jones Maltsberger has a nice 8 line track that is open. 
"Aug 10, 2019, 3:12:12 PM",Nice work!
"Aug 17, 2019, 4:33:55 PM","Steven‚Äôs watch said 15 even, and the way I was feeling I chose to trust his watch over mine!"
"Aug 19, 2019, 9:11:50 PM",I don't know how you manage to do these runs when it's 100 degrees!  I just walked 100 feet from my car and I want to die.
"Aug 21, 2019, 3:15:58 PM","I stayed home and ate a bag of chips, so you beat me.  Just keep putting in the work and it will come around for you!"
"Aug 21, 2019, 5:11:09 PM",Not even lunch time and you already got a double in?  Nice work!
"Sep 4, 2019, 4:27:49 PM",You are well on your way to becoming the number one beet-related agri-tourism destination in Southern San Antonio
"Sep 14, 2019, 4:42:54 PM",Very nice!  Steven and I must have just missed you on the greenway. 
"Oct 8, 2019, 3:08:10 PM",Strong work!
"Oct 13, 2019, 2:12:35 PM",Nice to see you on Strava!

"Oct 13, 2019, 5:38:57 PM",Looks like your watch struggled but you had no problems. Well done!
"Oct 14, 2019, 8:37:51 PM","Thanks, straight through!  This Pfitz plan has a lot of these race-pace sections as a part of longer runs. "
"Oct 15, 2019, 6:38:26 PM","I was trying to, but the workers were out with the heavy equipment so I only got half a mile or so before I turned back. "

"Oct 26, 2019, 4:17:16 PM",Happy birthday!  
"Nov 5, 2019, 12:34:25 AM","Yup, there‚Äôs a few coming over the next couple weeks!"
"Nov 16, 2019, 8:48:51 PM",I thought the same thing!  But then I realized I would have had to wake up before 8 am
"Nov 23, 2019, 4:19:31 PM","This is the life. Warm sun, cool ocean breezes, gettin‚Äô ripshit on ham. "
"Nov 26, 2019, 5:18:33 PM",I drink it every morning so I can fight like a crow!
"Dec 3, 2019, 6:22:30 PM",Thanks Fred!  Aiming for a BQ at Houston this January.  How about you?
"Dec 8, 2019, 10:02:49 PM",Thanks all!  
"Jan 4, 2020, 11:11:02 PM",You guys were looking strong out there! You'll do great in Houston!
"Jan 11, 2020, 4:28:11 PM","Likewise, Veronica Carrillo!"
"Jan 19, 2020, 10:28:51 PM",Let‚Äôs do an 18 mile long run in a couple weeks to discuss where your next one will be. ü§™
"Jan 19, 2020, 11:47:38 PM","Thanks so much everyone!  I had given up on ever qualifying for Boston, but running with all of you over the last two years has really pushed me and made running fun again.  "
"Jan 20, 2020, 1:06:54 AM","Great job, Sylvia!"
"Apr 2, 2020, 2:06:01 PM","I think a tiger sanctuary in LaVernia would be awesome.  Just bleach your hair, then get a mullet and an eyebrow piercing, Steven Exotic?"

"Apr 4, 2020, 5:04:35 PM","Wow, well done in those conditions!  Looking to forward to seeing what you can do now when racing returns."
"Apr 6, 2020, 8:20:35 PM",Mostly hamstring issues and a pretty bad abdominal strain. I definitely need to do some core work as I build mileage back up this time around. 
"Apr 13, 2020, 2:12:35 PM",If I could run .09 miles without stopping I‚Äôd be coming for it!

"Oct 5, 2020, 7:43:19 PM",Thanks üñ§üê∫Erica K üñ§üê∫. That looks like it could work if they go in-person. 
"Oct 5, 2020, 7:47:16 PM","Glenn McRill I‚Äôm planning on running Austin as well if it happens, but I‚Äôd like something flatter before that so I can take a shot at sub-3. "

"Nov 21, 2020, 8:00:10 PM","Yeah, solo 20-milers aren't fun.  I'd be in for next week, just let me know where you all are meeting up."

"Dec 27, 2020, 4:30:42 PM","Thanks Dawn Stadnyk. I‚Äôm hoping to get a sub-3 attempt somewhere in Feb. I‚Äôm signed up for run2bq, with Galveston as a back up."
"Jan 20, 2021, 3:26:36 PM",I sure do Kristopher koch!  Proximity to the park or the greenway was a big selling point when we were looking for a house.
"Jan 20, 2021, 3:34:25 PM","Congrats Kristopher koch !  That house is right around the corner from us.  It's a great location, and we like the neighborhood a lot."

"Apr 5, 2021, 2:13:10 AM",I think maybe it‚Äôs the inaccuracy of the Garmin‚Äôs wrist-based heart rate. There‚Äôs no way my HR really stayed in the 140s.

"Jun 23, 2021, 9:14:25 PM","Sylvia Prabudy Clark was open, but I started out looking for something a little closer to home.  Churchill HS was locked. Bradley, Driscoll, and Harris Middle schools all had shiny new fences installed with padlocks. I didn‚Äôt know Eisenhower had a track, I‚Äôll try that next time!"
"Jul 17, 2021, 3:26:21 PM",Thanks Robert Gonzalez. Looks like you all put some strong work in as well!

"Oct 23, 2021, 1:46:25 PM","Thanks Sylvia Prabudy!  BCS half, and then the full at Houston. Are you doing Houston again?"
"Oct 25, 2021, 3:56:56 PM","Kristopher koch It's a little more than a mile back to the neighborhood, so a 5 or 6 mile loop depending on which route you take through the park.  You're taking your life in your hands at a couple of those intersections though.  Saturday morning I saw a lady plow into a deer on J-M that had been standing still in the road for about 30 seconds."

"Jan 2, 2022, 10:35:02 PM","JFK is the park about 3 miles south of the Jack White trailhead. They have only poured about half a mile of concrete on the new trail, but the map shows a planned trail going at least a couple of miles"

"Feb 2, 2022, 2:01:21 PM",It's been a while since I've been to that section.  I'll probably head out that way Saturday and can let you know.
"Mar 5, 2022, 9:23:13 PM",Thanks Bryan Meyenberg!  Good luck on the half tomorrow

"May 28, 2022, 3:25:32 PM",Nice work!  Do you have a specific race in mind?
"May 28, 2022, 3:45:37 PM",That‚Äôs awesome. I‚Äôve heard nothing but good things about the MDI race and it looks beautiful. Chicago is the plan as long as I survive training through San Antonio summer.
