After halfway I tried to lock in a rhythm and get ready for the hills. Turns out a million trips between The Rim and Eisenhower was good prep cause I cruised through the Newton Hills without too much problem. The headwind picked up in the last 4 miles and I hit a pretty good wall at mile 24, but I managed to hold it together enough to stay under 3:07, which is only about 1:15 off my PR. 

I ran less total mileage this training cycle and just focused on the long runs and losing some weight. It helped me lose 15 lbs but most of my workouts were garbage.
